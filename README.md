# rust-web-server

## Start
Make sure you are on the latest nightly build. This will change once Rust v1.30.0 has been released.
To do this run `rustup override set nightly`

## Running
Simply run `cargo build` to build the solution and `cargo run` to fire it up. Alternatively you can run `cargo watch -x run`, this will force cargo to watch for file changes, compile and run the new build.
